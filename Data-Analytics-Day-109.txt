Machine Learning: Model Optimization & A/B Testing

1️⃣ Grid Search & Random Search (Hyperparameter Tuning)
===========================================================
What it is:
Hyperparameter tuning helps improve model performance by testing different combinations of parameters.

⭐ Grid Search
Tries every combination
Very accurate
Slow for large parameter sets

⭐ Random Search
Tries random combinations
Much faster
Covers wide search space

Example
Tuning RandomForest:
Grid Search tests all possible values of trees (50,100,200) × depth (5,10,15)
Random Search picks random combos like (100,10), (200,5)
Real World: E-commerce uses tuning to improve product recommendation accuracy.


2️⃣ Cross-Validation Techniques
====================================
Cross-validation ensures your model performs well on unseen data.
Common Methods
K-Fold CV → Most used
Stratified K-Fold → Keeps class ratios same
TimeSeriesSplit → For sequential data
Real World
Banks use K-Fold CV to ensure loan default prediction models don’t overfit.


3️⃣ A/B Testing for Business Decisions
=======================================
Used to compare two versions (A & B) to find which performs better.

Steps
Define goal (clicks, signups, revenue)
Split users 50/50
Show A to one group, B to another
Analyze metrics
Choose winner
Real World
Swiggy tests two versions of the checkout page → chooses the one with higher order completion rate.


4️⃣ Feature Selection Methods
====================================
Used to improve accuracy & reduce overfitting.

Types
Filter Methods → Correlation, Chi-square
Wrapper Methods → RFE
Embedded Methods → Lasso regression
Real World
Marketing model might remove irrelevant features like "browser theme," keeping only impactful ones like "session duration."


5️⃣ Case Study — Conversion Rate Optimization
=================================================
Problem
A company wants to increase conversions from 4% → 5%.

Process
Run A/B test on new UI
Train ML model to predict conversion
Use Random Search to tune model
Apply feature selection to reduce noise

Result
Conversion improved to 5.3%
Model accuracy increased from 82% → 89%
Reduced features from 30 → 14, making model faster
